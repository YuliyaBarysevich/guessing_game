      <p>Hey! My name is Julia. I am 25 years old. I was born in Minsk, Belarus. It is a small country between Western Europe and Estern Europe. Right after school I left my country.
      I entered the university in Vilnius, Lithuania. I studied International Law and Law of European Union. But after 3.5 years I realized it is not exactly what I want to do. And I moved to USA...</p>
      
      <p>When I was planning to move to USA I knew I would never live in New York. I visited NYC once, and it was awful. But fate dicided for me, and I came to New York City. And I am so happy that happened.
       Shortly after moving me and my partner opened a small buisnees and we continue to expand it in Russia and Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p>Currently I am so interested in Sofware Development. And I want to try myself in this area.</p>
      <p>I really love travelling. I've visited 36 out of 50 states including 28 National Parks. I love road trips, especially in USA. Also I like going to the gym (before COVID). Last year I tried snowboarding and now I have a new hobby. </p>
